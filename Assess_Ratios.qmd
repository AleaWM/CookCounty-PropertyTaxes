We're going to use the R package [cmfproperty](https://erhla.github.io/cmfproperty/articles/cmfproperty.html) to look at sales ratios: the traditional measurement of assessment accuracy to evaluate horizontal and vertical assessment equity in Cook County.

cmfproperty requires three pieces of data: PIN, sale year, sales price, and assessed value for the sales year.

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
library(cmfproperty)

ACVD <- Assessor_Commercial_Valuation_Data_20240212
```

Let's get rid of some of these...extra variables.

```{r}


```
