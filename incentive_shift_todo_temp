1. Identify useful example municipalities.

2. Figure out burden shift just to class 2 OR just properties that claim the GHE!!!!!

3. Discuss other incentive types.

4. Look at the following variables:
    A. current_rate vs. current_rate_mean. Why median? I think we actually COULD use the mode.
    B. burden_shift - don't think we want to multiple by 100

5. Some visualizations or something.
