Our primary data source was the contents of the database that accompanies the Cook County Assessor's Office property tax analysis package for R, PTAXSIM. The PTAXSIM github page contains extensive information on how they compiled their internal data. The data on this website reflects ptaxsim.db.2023.0.0, last updated: 2024-08-05 19:43:42 https://github.com/ccao-data/ptaxsim

We also cross-referenced our findings with the Cook County Treasurer's Office's property tax lookup tool, and the Cook County Recorder's Office's deed records.
