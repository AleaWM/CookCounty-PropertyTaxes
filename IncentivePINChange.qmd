# Data Preparation

```{r setup, warning = FALSE, output = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)

```

# Loading Incentive PIN Data

Data on incentive-class PINs was pulled from the PTAXSIM DB through the "helper_tc_muninames.R" helper file and the incentive data frame written to ".Output/7_output_incentive_classes.csv"

```{r, output = FALSE}

incentPINs <- read_csv("./Output/7_output_incentive_classes.csv")
```

# Trends in Incentive PINs Over Time

```{r}

incentPINs %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(nPINs = n())
```

# PIN Survival
