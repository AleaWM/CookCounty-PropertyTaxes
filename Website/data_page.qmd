Throughout our analysis, we use two structures of data. The first structure is PIN-level data and is used co calculate *[x, y, and z]*. The second structure is made up of summary files at the tax code, municipality, and County-wide levels. We use this structure for our analysis on *[Q, R, S]*.

# General Data

We use several sources of data across both data structures.

```{r setup}

library(tidyverse)

# Municipalities that are primarily outside of Cook County

# (This would be a good place to name them)

cross_county_lines <- c("030440000", "030585000", "030890000", "030320000", "031280000",
                        "030080000", "030560000", "031120000", "030280000", "030340000",
                        "030150000","030050000", "030180000","030500000", "031210000")

# We also identify class codes as commercial, residential, or industrial
