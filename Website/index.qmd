THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!
:::

All data was originally posted by the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO).

Tax data for Cook County was gathered using CCAO's `ptaxsim` package and corresponding database.

All summarizing of data was done by Research Assistants working for the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois Chicago.

If ignoring TIFs, the residential share of EAV is:

$$
ResidentrialShare = \frac{TaxableEAV_{residential} - ExemptEAV_{residential}} {TaxableEAV}
$$

$$
ResidentialShare = \frac{1-\lambda}{1-\lambda-\psi}
$$

$$
TaxableBase = AV_{equalized} - TIFincrement - EAV_{exempt} 
$$

$$
TIFincrement = AV_{equalized} - EAV_{frozen}
$$

The aggregate, or composite, tax rate is the sum of the individual taxing agency tax rates, or $\sum(rate_{agency})$, for all taxing agencies that tax a location. Each unique combination of taxing agencies is assigned a tax code by the assessor's office.

    # EAV in TIF pre-exe will be off becase EAV pre-exemptions will be off. 
   # "EAV in TIF Pre-Exe" = (EAV_pre_exemptions-`EAV outside TIF Post-Exe`),
   "Naive Savings" = scales::dollar(tax_amt_exe),
